# Weather-Journal App Project

## Project Content flow

- create the dynamic  at begining


-   add click event listener on generate button and then main() fn would fire as so
     - the user  will enter his fellings & city zip code 
     - the frontend then would send the api req to weathermap server & would recieve the data back
     - once frontend recieve the data it will send it to local server to get saved
     - and then local server would send "done" response
     - and then the frontend recieves the response & send get req on route '/all' to update the UI
